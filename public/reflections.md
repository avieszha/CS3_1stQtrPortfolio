# Reflections – 1st Quarter Portfolio

## 1. List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well.

1. **Arithmetic Operators**  
   I understand the basics of arithmetic operators since we used them a lot in exercises. They are symbols like +, -, *, /, and % that allow us to perform math inside programs. I’m more comfortable now with applying them correctly, especially because they also reflect real life operations. Having repeated practice made the concept clearer to me.  

2. **Conditional Statements (if-else)**  
   I am fairly familiar with conditional statements because they were introduced early on in my Pisay life and we practiced them often. They let the program decide what action to take depending on whether a condition is true or false. I can follow how they work in simple programs, though I sometimes get confused when the conditions become too long.  

3. **Loops (for, while, do-while)**  
   Loops make sense to me because we practiced using them for repetition instead of writing the same code many times. I know the difference between a `for` loop, which is often used when the number of repetitions is known, and a `while` loop, which runs as long as a condition is true. The `do-while` loop is also useful since it executes at least once. I still need practice tracing the flow carefully, but I can explain the main idea.  

4. **Functions**  
   I have a basic understanding of functions since we used them in small coding tasks. They make the program more organized by grouping instructions together. I can write simple functions and call them, but I am still careful when it comes to parameters and return values. Overall, I get the purpose of functions but need more experience to be confident.  

5. **Arrays**  
   I am familiar with arrays since we worked with them a lot last school year. They allow us to store many values in a single variable, which makes coding more efficient. I can describe how to access elements by their index, and I understand that arrays are often used together with loops. 

## 2. List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but need further practice/discussion and why.  

1. **Nested Loops** – I know that they are loops inside loops, but I get lost when tracing values, especially in bigger problems.  
2. **Logical Operators** – I understand what they are, but I sometimes mix up the outputs when combining them in complicated conditions.  
3. **Switch Statements** – I can explain what a switch does, but I forget when it is more practical than using multiple if-else statements.  
4. **Scope of Variables** – I know the difference between global and local scope, but I get confused when my variables don’t work as I expected.  
5. **Debugging Techniques** – I am aware of basic debugging like using `console.log`, but I don’t have a clear system for finding errors in longer programs.  

## 3. Describe what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second item.  

1. For **nested loops**, I will practice by solving smaller examples step by step until I get more comfortable with tracing.  
2. For **logical operators**, I will review truth tables and write simple code tests to check if my predictions match the output.  
3. For **switch statements**, I will review my notes and write extra exercises to see how switch compares to if-else in real cases.  
4. For **scope of variables**, I will experiment by creating programs with variables declared in different places to observe the results.  
5. For **debugging techniques**, I will try to use `console.log` more often and ask classmates or check online resources when I get stuck.  

## 4. In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why.  

1. **Effective Activities**  
   - The coding exercises during class were effective because I was able to apply the lessons directly. Trying them out helped me see my mistakes and learn faster.  
   - Group activities were effective since I could learn from how my classmates explained things, which gave me another perspective.  

2. **Not Effective Activities**  
   - Copying long notes was not very effective for me because I was more focused on writing than understanding.  
   - Activities with too many steps at once were not effective since I sometimes got confused about what to do first.
