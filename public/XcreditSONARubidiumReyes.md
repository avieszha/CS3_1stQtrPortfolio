# Take on SONA July 2025 of Pres. Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.
### by Avisha Marie Fatima P. Reyes, Rubidium

1. **₱20 Rice Achieved** – The long-promised ₱20/kilo rice was finally achieved and expanded through KADIWA stores across the country. What stood out was the president saying this was done *without harming* the livelihood of farmers, something I honestly didn’t expect to hear in the same sentence as price drops. (lets fact check that hehe!)
2. **Zero Balance Billing in DOH Hospitals** – Public hospital services under PhilHealth now follow a zero balance billing system, meaning no patient will pay out-of-pocket for basic accommodation services.
3. **Massive Tech and Internet Expansion** – The National Fiber Backbone, free Wi-Fi sites, and SIM cards for remote learners aim to fully digitize education and public service. Even remote public schools are now promised internet by end of the year.
4. **Sports as Nation-Building** – New nationwide programs promote sports from early education to elite levels, including support for athletes and grassroots initiatives like intramurals and free “Love Buses.”

## Points I Found Weird
1. **Winter Games Curling Champions** – The mention of a *Philippine Men’s Curling Team* winning the Asian Winter Games felt oddly out of place considering we’re a tropical country...
2. **Use of “Love Bus”** – Reviving a 1970s concept and making it free seemed a bit weird po HAHAH, but I get the desire to revive simpler times.
3. **Exposing Corruption on Stage** – Publicly shaming corrupt officials with phrases like “mahiya naman kayo” felt more like a cathartic monologue than a formal government address (but also… haha..).


## Reflection Paragraphs

There was a lot. And I mean *a lot.* Listening to the president felt like watching someone try to sprint through an entire administration’s worth of action plans in under two hours. But amidst the flood of numbers and acronyms, a few things stuck. Like how farmers are supposedly protected while ₱20 rice gets rolled out, or how public hospitals are now promising zero bills for patients under PhilHealth. It almost sounds *too good* which makes me want to believe, and not believe, at the same time.

Still, I think what made this SONA different is that it didn’t pretend everything was fine. And I guess I appreciated that. The fact that he said “mahiya naman kayo” on national TV felt weird but kind of cathartic, too. We’ve heard promises before, but what matters more is whether they’re still being talked about and fought for next year, and the year after that; change shouldn't only be talked about, it should also be acted upon :))

## My Word for the Philippines After SONA 2025
